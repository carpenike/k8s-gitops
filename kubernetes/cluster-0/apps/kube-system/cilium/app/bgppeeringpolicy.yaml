# MAKE SURE CRDs ARE INSTALLED IN CLUSTER VIA cilium-config ConfigMap OR Cilium HelmRelease/values.yaml (bgpControlPlane.enabled: true), BEFORE THIS IS APPLIED!
# "CiliumBGPPeeringPolicy" Custom Resource will replace the old MetalLB BGP's "bgp-config" ConfigMap
# "CiliumBGPPeeringPolicy" is used with `bgpControlPlane.enabled: true` which uses GoBGP, NOT the old `bgp.enabled: true` which uses MetalLB
